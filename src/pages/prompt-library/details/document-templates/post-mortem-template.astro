            <h2>What is this prompt?</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive template for writing blameless post-mortems that focus on organizational learning rather than individual blame. This prompt generates incident reports with detailed timelines, root cause analysis, quantified impact, actionable improvements, and systems-focused language that builds psychological safety while ensuring honest incident review.</p>

            <h2>When to use it</h2>
            <p>Use this prompt after significant incidents, outages, or failures to understand what happened, why systems allowed it, and what changes prevent recurrence. Blameless post-mortems create psychological safety—people report issues honestly because they know the focus is learning, not punishment.</p>

            <h2>Why This Prompt Works (Principle Annotations)</h2>

            <h3>Principle 1 (Purpose)</h3>
            <p><strong>"Helps the organization learn from this incident"</strong> — Post-mortems exist to prevent recurrence, not to assign blame.</p>

            <h3>Principle 2 (Structure as Logic)</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary → Timeline → Root Cause → Impact → What Worked → What Failed → Actions</strong></p>

            <h3>Principle 3 (Constraints)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>800 words</strong> forces focus on essential learnings</li>
                <li><strong>"Must use actual timestamps"</strong> grounds timeline in facts</li>
                <li><strong>"Root cause must go deeper than trigger"</strong> prevents shallow analysis</li>
                <li><strong>"Must focus on systems not people"</strong> enforces blameless culture</li>
                <li><strong>"Action items must have owner and date"</strong> ensures follow-through</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Principle 5 (Failure Modes)</h3>
            <p>This prompt addresses how post-mortems typically fail:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blame individuals instead of systems</li>
                <li>Surface-level root cause ("the server crashed" vs "we had no circuit breaker")</li>
                <li>Vague impact ("several users affected")</li>
                <li>Timeline without specific times</li>
                <li>Action items without owners (nothing gets fixed)</li>
            </ul>

            <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);">

            <h2>How to Customize This Prompt</h2>

            <h3>For your incident management process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you use incident levels:</strong> Add "Severity Level" section with your org's definitions</li>
                <li><strong>If you track SLOs:</strong> Add "SLO Impact" section showing which SLOs were breached</li>
                <li><strong>If you do incident reviews:</strong> Add "Review Date" and "Attendees" at top</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For different incident types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Attack Vector", "Data Exposure", "Remediation Steps"</li>
                <li><strong>Data incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Data Affected", "Data Recovery", "Data Quality Impact"</li>
                <li><strong>Customer-facing incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Customer Communications", "Support Ticket Volume"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Mistake: Blaming People Instead of Systems</h2>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Post-mortems include language like "John forgot to set up monitoring" or "Sarah should have noticed the disk filling." This destroys psychological safety and prevents honest incident reports in the future.</p>

            <h3>The Right Reframe</h3>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "John forgot to set up monitoring"</p>
            <p><strong>Write:</strong> "We had no disk usage monitoring on gateway instances"</p>
            <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Sarah should have noticed the disk filling"</p>
            <p><strong>Write:</strong> "We lacked alerting that would have caught this before outage"</p>
            <p>The question isn't "who messed up"—it's "what systemic gap allowed this to happen."</p>
