            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In my role at an EdTech company, I identified a critical inefficiency: our sales team processed hundreds of thousands of annual leads with an enrollment rate of less than 3%. This meant massive effort spent on leads unlikely to convert.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Rather than traditional lead prioritization, I asked a different question: <strong>What if we could confidently identify which leads NOT to pursue?</strong></p>

            <p>As a CX Manager without formal data science training, I used Claude Code to build this solution. My domain expertise guided the development while Claude Code handled the technical implementation.</p>

            <h2>The "Don't Engage" Innovation</h2>
            <p>The breakthrough was reframing the problem. Instead of prioritizing leads, we identify the <strong>low-probability leads to safely ignore</strong>.</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>The XGBoost model analyzes lead characteristics like enrollment intent, timing preferences, marketing channel, and engagement patterns to predict conversion probability. Leads scoring below a carefully calibrated threshold are filtered from sales outreach.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box--alt mt-1">
                    <strong>Risk Management:</strong> We set conservative thresholds (95%+ precision) and validated that 25% of "missed" enrollments happen through other channels anyway, reducing true risk to just 3.5%.
