                <h2>What is this prompt?</h2>
                <p>A comprehensive template for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that align teams on what to build, why it matters, and how success will be measured. This prompt generates PRDs with clear user stories, testable acceptance criteria, technical constraints, and documented open questions.</p>

                <h2>When to use it</h2>
                <p>Use this prompt when defining product scope, aligning engineering teams on requirements, or translating business goals into implementation-ready specifications. PRDs prevent miscommunication between product and engineering teams by making requirements explicit, testable, and unambiguous.</p>

                <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);">

                <h2>Why This Prompt Works (Principle Annotations)</h2>

                <h3>Principle 1 (Purpose)</h3>
                <p><strong>"Bridges what we're building with how we'll build it"</strong> — PRDs exist to align product and engineering, preventing the "that's not what I meant" conversation three weeks into development.</p>

                <h3>Principle 2 (Structure as Logic)</h3>
                <p><strong>What → Why → Success → User Stories → Acceptance → Non-Goals → Constraints → Open Questions</strong></p>
                <p>This is the translation sequence: outcome → justification → measurement → user perspective → technical specification → boundaries → engineering context → remaining decisions.</p>

                <h3>Principle 3 (Constraints)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>800 words</strong> forces ruthless prioritization</li>
                    <li><strong>"Must be testable"</strong> prevents vague requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>"Non-Goals as specific as goals"</strong> prevents scope expansion</li>
                    <li><strong>"DO NOT prescribe solution"</strong> respects engineering expertise</li>
                    <li><strong>"If requirement isn't explicit, it's an Open Question"</strong> prevents assumptions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 4 (Self-Evaluation)</h3>
                <p>Quality checks ensure the PRD is actually implementable. <strong>"QA can verify pass/fail"</strong> is the ultimate test for acceptance criteria.</p>

                <h3>Principle 5 (Failure Modes)</h3>
                <p>This prompt addresses how PRDs typically fail:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vague requirements ("improve user experience")</li>
                    <li>Missing edge cases (only happy path defined)</li>
                    <li>Solution prescribed instead of problem described</li>
                    <li>Success criteria that can't be measured at launch</li>
                    <li>Scope creep (everything is in scope)</li>
                    <li>Unstated technical constraints</li>
                    <li>Undocumented open questions that block development</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 6 (Input Quality)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Use only information from input"</strong> prevents AI from inventing user needs</li>
                    <li><strong>"Do not infer technical constraints"</strong> prevents fake performance targets</li>
                    <li>Requires user research and technical constraints up front</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 7 (Voice)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Precise and testable, not aspirational"</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"Declarative, not suggestive"</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"Specific about edge cases"</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>PRDs fail when they're vague or optimistic. This voice prevents that.</p>

                <h3>Principle 9 (Workflow)</h3>
                <p><strong>"Will be referenced during implementation"</strong> tells AI this is a working document, not a pitch deck. Engineering will point to specific lines when asking questions, so precision matters more than salesmanship.</p>

                <h2>How to Customize This Prompt</h2>

                <h3>For your engineering culture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If eng owns solutions:</strong> Keep "DO NOT prescribe solution" strict</li>
                    <li><strong>If product specifies approach:</strong> Add "Recommended Approach" section with technical suggestions</li>
                    <li><strong>If you do mob programming:</strong> Add "Pairing Sessions" section with product involvement schedule</li>
                    <li><strong>If you do agile sprints:</strong> Break user stories into story points with engineering input</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For your product process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If you do design first:</strong> Add "Design Resources" section linking to Figma with implementation notes</li>
                    <li><strong>If you validate in production:</strong> Add "Rollout Plan" with feature flags and A/B test strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>If you iterate quickly:</strong> Add "V1 vs. V2" section showing phased rollout</li>
                    <li><strong>If you need analytics:</strong> Add "Instrumentation Requirements" with specific events to track</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For different feature types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>API features:</strong> Add "API Contract" section with endpoints, methods, request/response formats</li>
                    <li><strong>Data features:</strong> Add "Data Requirements" with schemas, relationships, migration needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance features:</strong> Make Technical Constraints section more detailed (latency, throughput, resource usage)</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform features:</strong> Add "Integration Points" showing what systems connect</li>
                    <li><strong>Experimental features:</strong> Add "Success Thresholds" showing when to kill the experiment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For your failure modes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If scope expands:</strong> Make Non-Goals section 50% length of User Stories</li>
                    <li><strong>If edge cases get missed:</strong> Add "Error Scenarios" section forcing you to think through failures</li>
                    <li><strong>If testing is weak:</strong> Add "Test Scenarios" section with specific test cases</li>
                    <li><strong>If technical constraints are ignored:</strong> Add "Performance Requirements" as separate section with consequences ("If &lt;200ms not met, feature is blocked from launch")</li>
                    <li><strong>If open questions linger:</strong> Add "Decision Deadline" column and escalation path</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Mistake: Prescribing the Solution</h2>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Product managers write "Use Redis for caching" or "Implement with React hooks" in PRDs. This crosses the line from what to build into how to build it, which is engineering's domain.</p>

                <h3>Why This Breaks</h3>
                <p>You might be wrong about the solution. Or there's a better approach you don't know about. Or technical constraints make your suggestion impossible. Either way, you've now tied engineering's hands or created conflict.</p>

                <h3>How This Prompt Prevents It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"DO NOT prescribe solution" constraint</li>
                    <li>Quality check: "No solution prescribed"</li>
                    <li>Technical Constraints section gives engineering context without dictating approach</li>
                    <li>Open Questions section is where to surface technical unknowns</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Right Way</h3>
                <p>Instead of "Use Redis for caching to hit &lt;200ms response time," write:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Constraint:</strong> "API response &lt;200ms at P95 under 1000 RPS"</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Question:</strong> "What caching strategy will hit performance target? Decision: James (Eng Lead) by Nov 8"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This gives engineering the requirement (200ms) and trusts them to pick the solution (maybe it's Redis, maybe it's something better).</p>

                <h3>The Hard Truth</h3>
                <p>If you don't trust engineering to pick good solutions, that's a people problem, not a PRD problem. Fix the people problem. Don't use the PRD to micromanage technical decisions.</p>

                    <h4>YOUR TASK:</h4>
                    <p>Create a PRD that gives engineering everything they need to build this without constant back-and-forth. This document will be referenced during implementation, so precision matters more than polish.</p>

                    <h4>REQUIRED STRUCTURE:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What We're Building</strong> (2-3 sentences: the feature in user terms, not technical terms)</li>

                        <li><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> (For each user story, the testable conditions that define "done")</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Goals</strong> (What we're explicitly NOT building - prevents scope creep)</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Constraints</strong> (What engineering must work within - APIs, performance, scale)</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Questions</strong> (What's undecided and who will decide it by when)</li>

                        <li>Why Now: Must include quantified user problem and business impact</li>
                        <li>Success criteria: Must be measurable at launch (e.g., "85% of flows complete without errors" not "improve reliability")</li>
                        <li>User stories: Must follow exact format and include user type, action, and benefit</li>
                        <li>Acceptance criteria: Must be testable (e.g., "User can upload files up to 50MB" not "File upload works well")</li>
                        <li>Non-Goals: Must be as specific as user stories</li>
                        <li>Technical constraints: Must include performance targets (e.g., "API response &lt;200ms at P95 under 1000 RPS")</li>
                        <li>Open questions: Must have owner and decision deadline</li>
