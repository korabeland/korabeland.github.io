                <h2>What is this prompt?</h2>
                <p>A comprehensive template for writing blameless post-mortems that focus on organizational learning rather than individual blame. This prompt generates incident reports with detailed timelines, root cause analysis, quantified impact, actionable improvements, and systems-focused language that builds psychological safety while ensuring honest incident review.</p>

                <h2>When to use it</h2>
                <p>Use this prompt after significant incidents, outages, or failures to understand what happened, why systems allowed it, and what changes prevent recurrence. Blameless post-mortems create psychological safety—people report issues honestly because they know the focus is learning, not punishment.</p>

                <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);">

                <h2>Why This Prompt Works (Principle Annotations)</h2>

                <h3>Principle 1 (Purpose)</h3>
                <p><strong>"Helps the organization learn from this incident"</strong> — Post-mortems exist to prevent recurrence, not to assign blame. The structure forces learning focus: what happened → why → how to prevent.</p>

                <h3>Principle 2 (Structure as Logic)</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary → Timeline → Root Cause → Impact → What Worked → What Failed → Actions</strong></p>
                <p>This is the incident review sequence: "What happened? When exactly? Why did it happen? How bad was it? What worked in our response? What didn't work? What are we fixing?"</p>

                <h3>Principle 3 (Constraints)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>800 words</strong> forces focus on essential learnings</li>
                    <li><strong>"Must use actual timestamps"</strong> grounds timeline in facts</li>
                    <li><strong>"Root cause must go deeper than trigger"</strong> prevents shallow analysis</li>
                    <li><strong>"Must focus on systems not people"</strong> enforces blameless culture</li>
                    <li><strong>"Action items must have owner and date"</strong> ensures follow-through</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 4 (Self-Evaluation)</h3>
                <p>Quality checks ensure post-mortem enables learning. <strong>"Action items address root cause, not just symptoms"</strong> is the key test.</p>

                <h3>Principle 5 (Failure Modes)</h3>
                <p>This prompt addresses how post-mortems typically fail:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blame individuals instead of systems</li>
                    <li>Surface-level root cause ("the server crashed" vs "we had no circuit breaker")</li>
                    <li>Vague impact ("several users affected")</li>
                    <li>Timeline without specific times (can't reconstruct events)</li>
                    <li>Action items without owners (nothing gets fixed)</li>
                    <li>Action items address symptoms not causes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 6 (Input Quality)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Use actual timestamps from inputs"</strong> prevents rounded times</li>
                    <li><strong>"Use actual numbers from monitoring"</strong> prevents minimizing impact</li>
                    <li><strong>"Do not invent timeline events"</strong> keeps facts accurate</li>
                    <li>Requires monitoring data and logs as inputs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Principle 7 (Voice)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Factual and learning-oriented"</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"Systems-focused not people-focused"</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>"DO NOT blame"</strong> / <strong>"DO NOT sugarcoat"</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Post-mortems need psychological safety (blameless) combined with honesty (no sugarcoating). This voice balances both.</p>

                <h3>Principle 9 (Workflow)</h3>
                <p><strong>"Will be read by people who weren't involved"</strong> tells AI this isn't just for the incident team—it's organizational knowledge capture. Therefore context and clarity matter more than insider shorthand.</p>

                <h2>How to Customize This Prompt</h2>

                <h3>For your incident management process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If you use incident levels:</strong> Add "Severity Level" section with your org's definitions (P0/P1/P2 or SEV1/SEV2/etc)</li>
                    <li><strong>If you track SLOs:</strong> Add "SLO Impact" section showing which SLOs were breached and by how much</li>
                    <li><strong>If you do incident reviews:</strong> Add "Review Date" and "Attendees" at top</li>
                    <li><strong>If you assign incident commanders:</strong> Add "Incident Commander" to Context section</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For your organization culture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If blameless is new:</strong> Emphasize in constraints: "Replace any 'X should have' with 'The system lacked Y'"</li>
                    <li><strong>If you track action items:</strong> Add "Action Item Status" column (Not Started/In Progress/Complete)</li>
                    <li><strong>If you need exec visibility:</strong> Add "Executive Summary" section at top (3 sentences: what, impact, fix)</li>
                    <li><strong>If you do quarterly reviews:</strong> Add "Related Incidents" section linking to similar past incidents</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>For different incident types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Attack Vector", "Data Exposure", "Remediation Steps", "Compliance Implications"</li>
                    <li><strong>Data incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Data Affected", "Data Recovery", "Data Quality Impact"</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Performance Metrics", "Capacity Analysis", "Scaling Response"</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer-facing incidents:</strong> Add sections: "Customer Communications", "Support Ticket Volume", "Customer Impact by Segment"</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>For your failure modes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If action items don't get done:</strong> Add "Review Date" showing when actions will be verified complete</li>
                    <li><strong>If root cause is shallow:</strong> Add check: "Root cause must answer 'why' at least 3 times" (5 whys technique)</li>
                    <li><strong>If impact is minimized:</strong> Add constraint: "Impact must include customer quotes or support ticket data"</li>
                    <li><strong>If blame creeps in:</strong> Add check: "Find/replace check for 'should have', 'forgot to', 'didn't realize'"</li>
                    <li><strong>If learning isn't captured:</strong> Add section: "Key Learnings" separate from action items</li>
                </ul>

                <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);">

                <h2>Common Mistake: Blaming People Instead of Systems</h2>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Post-mortems include language like "John forgot to set up monitoring" or "Sarah should have noticed the disk filling" or "If someone had checked the logs..." This destroys psychological safety and prevents honest incident reports in the future.</p>

                <h3>Why This Breaks</h3>
                <p>When people are blamed in post-mortems, teams start hiding incidents, minimizing impact, and covering up mistakes. You get less information about what's actually broken. The organization can't learn if people are afraid to be honest.</p>

                <h3>How This Prompt Prevents It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"DO NOT blame: Focus on system failures, not people failures" constraint</li>
                    <li>"What went poorly must focus on systems/processes, never individuals"</li>
                    <li>Quality check: "No blame language anywhere"</li>
                    <li>Quality check: "'What went poorly' critiques systems/processes, never names individuals"</li>
                    <li>Tone: "Systems-focused not people-focused"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Right Reframe</h3>
                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "John forgot to set up monitoring"<br>
                <strong>Write:</strong> "We had no disk usage monitoring on gateway instances"</p>

                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Sarah should have noticed the disk filling"<br>
                <strong>Write:</strong> "We lacked alerting that would have caught this before outage"</p>

                <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "If someone had checked the logs..."<br>
                <strong>Write:</strong> "We had no automated log analysis to surface this pattern"</p>

                <p>The question isn't "who messed up"—it's "what systemic gap allowed this to happen." Good post-mortems identify the gaps so the organization can fix them.</p>

                    <h4>CONTEXT:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Incident name:</strong> [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED]</p>
                    <p><strong>Date/time of incident:</strong> [WHEN THIS OCCURRED]</p>
                    <p><strong>Severity:</strong> [IMPACT LEVEL - e.g. "production outage" or "data inconsistency" or "security incident"]</p>
                    <p><strong>Affected systems/users:</strong> [WHAT/WHO WAS IMPACTED]</p>
                    <p><strong>Team involved:</strong> [WHO RESPONDED]</p>

                    <p>[PASTE YOUR TIMELINE, MONITORING DATA, SLACK LOGS, ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, RESPONSE ACTIONS HERE]</p>

                    <h4>YOUR TASK:</h4>
                    <p>Create a post-mortem that helps the organization learn from this incident. This will be read by people who weren't involved and need to understand what happened and what changes we're making. Blameless tone is critical.</p>

                    <h4>REQUIRED STRUCTURE:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Summary</strong> (What happened in 2-3 sentences - impact and duration)</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeline</strong> (Chronological events from detection to resolution - use actual timestamps from inputs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Root Cause</strong> (The actual underlying reason, not just the proximate trigger)</li>
                        <li><strong>Impact</strong> (Quantified user/business impact - numbers from actual data)</li>
                        <li><strong>What Went Well</strong> (What worked in our response - be specific)</li>
                        <li><strong>What Went Poorly</strong> (What failed in detection, response, or prevention - be honest)</li>
                        <li><strong>Action Items</strong> (Specific fixes with owners and deadlines - prevent recurrence)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Total length: 800 words maximum</li>
                        <li>Summary: Must quantify impact (users affected, duration, revenue impact if available)</li>
                        <li>Timeline: Must use actual timestamps from inputs (not rounded or estimated)</li>
                        <li>Root cause: Must go deeper than surface trigger ("load increased" is not root cause - why didn't system handle load?)</li>
                        <li>Impact: Must use actual numbers from monitoring/logs (not "many users" or "significant downtime")</li>
                        <li>What went well: Must be specific actions/decisions, not generic praise</li>
                        <li>What went poorly: Must focus on systems/processes, never individuals</li>

                        <li>Systems-focused ("We lacked redundancy") not people-focused ("Someone should have checked")</li>
                        <li>Action-oriented in fixes, not just analysis</li>
