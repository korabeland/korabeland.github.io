You are writing technical documentation that enables someone to actually accomplish a task, not just understand a concept.



CONTEXT:

What this documents: [FEATURE/SYSTEM/TOOL NAME]

Who uses this: [USER ROLE/TECHNICAL LEVEL - e.g. "developers integrating our API" or "non-technical end users"]

Common use case: [THE PRIMARY TASK USERS ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH]

Support context: [HOW THIS FITS IN SUPPORT - e.g. "referenced in 30% of support tickets"]



INPUT PROVIDED:

[PASTE YOUR TECHNICAL SPECS, API DETAILS, SYSTEM BEHAVIOR, ERROR CASES, EXAMPLES HERE]



YOUR TASK:

Create documentation that someone can follow step-by-step without prior knowledge. This will be used when things go wrong, so troubleshooting matters as much as happy path.



REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

1. **Prerequisites** (What user needs before starting - tools, access, knowledge)

2. **Overview** (What this does in 2-3 sentences - outcomes not features)

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** (Numbered steps with expected result after each step)

4. **Code Examples** (Working examples they can copy-paste, with comments explaining key lines)

5. **Common Errors** (The 5 most common failures with exact error messages and fixes)

6. **Troubleshooting** (Decision tree: if X happens, check Y, try Z)

7. **Related Resources** (Links to related docs, API references, support)



CONSTRAINTS:

- Total length: 1000 words maximum

- Prerequisites: Must be exhaustive - include version numbers, permissions, dependencies from your inputs

- Overview: Must explain what user will accomplish, not what the system does

- Instructions: Each step must show expected result from the actual system

- Code examples: Must be complete and use actual syntax/endpoints from inputs (no placeholder code)

- Common errors: Must use exact error message text from inputs (this helps users search)

- Troubleshooting: Must be decision-tree format with specific checks from the actual system

- DO NOT assume: If a step requires knowledge, link to explanation or include it

- DO NOT skip: Error cases and edge cases are not optional (that's when docs get used)

- DO NOT invent: Use only actual error messages, endpoints, commands from inputs - no made-up examples



TONE:

- Imperative and specific ("Run `[actual command from inputs]`") not suggestive

- Include exact commands, file paths, environment variables from the real system

- Assume user is following instructions exactly (precision matters)

- Patient with errors (these docs are read when things are broken)



QUALITY CHECKS - Before outputting, verify:

- [ ] Prerequisites list includes actual version numbers from inputs

- [ ] Every instruction step shows actual expected output from the system

- [ ] All code examples use real endpoints/syntax from inputs (no fake URLs or placeholder values)

- [ ] Code examples include comments explaining key lines

- [ ] Every common error uses exact error text from inputs

- [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses actual failure modes from inputs

- [ ] No invented examples - everything comes from inputs provided

- [ ] File paths match actual system paths from inputs

- [ ] No step assumes knowledge not covered in prerequisites

- [ ] Every "if this fails" has a corresponding "try this" action from real troubleshooting

- [ ] Total word count is under 1000 words



If any check fails, revise before outputting.
