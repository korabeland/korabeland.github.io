# PRD Folder Guide

This folder contains templates and evaluation frameworks for **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**.

## Files in This Folder

- **prd.md** - The production-ready PRD template. Use this to generate PRDs with clear structure, scope boundaries, and decision frameworks.
- **prd_guide.md** - Design philosophy and educational guide explaining why the PRD template is structured as it is, with annotations linking to the 9 Principles of Quality Business Writing.
- **PRD_quality_evaluator.md** - Quality evaluation framework for assessing PRDs on 5 key dimensions: Completeness, Testability, Scoping, Decision Framework, and Dependency Mapping.

## How to Use

1. Start with **prd_guide.md** to understand the principles behind effective PRDs
2. Use **prd.md** to generate your PRD with the required inputs and constraints
3. Evaluate your PRD with **PRD_quality_evaluator.md** to ensure it meets quality standards

## Key Principle

PRDs drive engineering decisions. Every section should answer the question: "What decision does this enable?"
