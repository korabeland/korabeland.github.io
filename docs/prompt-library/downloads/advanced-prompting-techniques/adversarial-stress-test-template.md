[YOUR INITIAL REQUEST AND MODEL RESPONSE]

Now attack your previous answer:

1. Identify five specific ways it could be wrong, incomplete, or fail under adversarial conditions
2. For each vulnerability, rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and likelihood (Likely/Possible/Unlikely)
3. Propose specific revisions to address each issue
4. Provide the hardened version incorporating all improvements

Be aggressive in finding problems - I need stress-testing, not validation.
