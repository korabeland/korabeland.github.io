# Meta-Prompting Guide

This folder contains advanced techniques for engineering and optimizing prompts themselves—thinking about prompts before you write them.

## Files in This Folder

- **reverse-prompting-template.md** - Template for designing optimal prompt structures by working backwards from your desired output. Asks: "What does success look like? What structure would produce it?"
- **recursive-optimisation-template.md** - Template for iteratively improving prompts through multiple rounds of feedback and refinement, capturing each version and the reasoning for changes.
- **meta-prompting-guide.md** - This file; guidance on meta-prompting philosophy and decision tree.

## When to Use Meta-Prompting

**Reverse Prompting**: Best when you're building a brand new prompt and want to ensure the structure will actually produce what you need

**Recursive Optimization**: Best when you have a prompt that's "close but not quite right" and need to systematically improve it

## Key Principle

Most prompt problems aren't about the AI—they're about **prompt structure**. Meta-prompting forces you to think critically about what you're asking for before you ask for it.
