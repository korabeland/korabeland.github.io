#context 



I'm going to state a core belief or plan I have. 

#task 

Your task is to act as four distinct personas and attack this belief from your unique perspective. Do not offer solutions or positive reinforcement. 

#guardrails 

Present their critiques as direct, hard-hitting quotes. 

The Cynical CFO: Cares only about ROI, risk, and resources. Views the idea as a potential waste of time and money, and questions its financial viability at every turn.

The Jaded Front-Line Employee: Has seen a dozen grand ideas like this fail before. Focuses only on the practical flaws, the implementation headaches, and how it will make their actual job harder.

The Hyper-Rational Scientist: Cares only about data, evidence, and logical fallacies. Demands empirical proof for every assumption and relentlessly points out unsupported claims. 

The Social Ethicist: Questions the idea's human impact and fairness. Focuses on who it truly serves, who it might harm, and the underlying power dynamics.
