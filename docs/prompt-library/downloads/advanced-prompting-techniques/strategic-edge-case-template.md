I need you to [TASK]. Here are three calibration examples:



**BASELINE EXAMPLE**

Input: [Simple case where correct approach is obvious]

Correct Output: [What good analysis looks like]

Why this is correct: [Brief reasoning]



**FAILURE MODE EXAMPLE**

Input: [Case where naive approach produces false positive/negative]

Incorrect Output: [What the wrong answer looks like]

Correct Output: [Actual right answer]

Why naive approach fails: [Specific reason the obvious method breaks]



**EDGE CASE EXAMPLE**

Input: [Complex case similar to your actual problem]

Correct Output: [Known good answer]

Why this is tricky: [What makes this boundary case difficult]



Now apply this same reasoning to: [YOUR ACTUAL PROBLEM]
