2. **Current State** (shipped features, key metrics, customer feedback themes)
3. **Roadmap Overview** (6-month visual timeline with major releases and milestones)
4. **Priority Features** (top 5 features with customer impact and business rationale)
5. **Resource Allocation** (engineering capacity, design needs, timeline estimates)
6. **Customer Impact** (how planned features address top customer requests and pain points)
7. **Technical Foundation** (platform work, technical debt, infrastructure requirements)
8. **Success Metrics** (KPIs for measuring roadmap progress and feature adoption)
9. **Risk Mitigation** (dependencies, technical challenges, market timing risks)
10. **Stakeholder Alignment** (sales enablement, marketing support, customer communication plan)
