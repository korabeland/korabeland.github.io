                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>As the builder of chatbots serving prospective postgraduate students at three Australian universities (UNSW, Southern Cross University, and Victoria University), I needed a systematic way to evaluate chatbot performance across 3000+ real-world conversations collected over four months. These chatbots answer critical questions about courses, fees, entry requirements, and career outcomes - information that directly impacts students' educational decisions.</p>

                <p>The challenge wasn't just volume. I had already identified recurring issues: the chatbots were hallucinating course details, providing excessively lengthy responses, and giving inconsistent information within the same conversation. But I didn't want to impose predetermined evaluation criteria that might miss other important patterns in the data. I needed an approach that would let quality dimensions emerge naturally from actual user interactions.</p>

                <p>Traditional chatbot evaluation methods often rely on preset rubrics or metrics that may not capture the nuances of educational customer experience. I wanted to build something more rigorous - a framework grounded in what actually happens in these conversations, not what we assume should matter.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title--lg">The Goal</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Create a data-driven evaluation framework that systematically assesses chatbot quality across thousands of conversations, progressing from qualitative analysis to semi-automated LLM-based evaluation while maintaining methodological rigor.</p>

                <h2>Development Approach</h2>
                <p>Rather than starting with assumptions about what makes a "good" chatbot conversation, I adopted a grounded theory methodology - a qualitative research approach where evaluation criteria emerge from systematic observation of the data itself. This methodology is particularly powerful for complex domains where quality is multifaceted and context-dependent.</p>

                <p>Working with Claude Code, I designed a four-phase evolution that balances research rigor with practical scalability. Each phase builds on the previous one, progressing from deep manual analysis to semi-automated evaluation.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>The system is built around a principle: quality criteria should emerge from the data, not be imposed on it. Starting with 32,069 conversations spanning February to July 2025, I used stratified sampling to create a representative subset that maintains diversity across universities and conversation complexity.</p>

                    <h4>Core Methodology</h4>
                    <ol class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Stratified Sampling</strong>: Python scripts filter for chatbot-tagged conversations across three universities, then sample 100 conversations proportionally by university and conversation length (short, medium, long)</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Coding</strong>: Manual review of each conversation with descriptive observations - noting patterns, issues, and effective moments without applying predetermined criteria</li>
                        <li><strong>Axial Coding</strong>: Analysis of all observations to identify recurring themes, group similar patterns, and quantify frequency of each category</li>
                        <li><strong>Framework Creation</strong>: Convert identified themes into concrete evaluation dimensions with scoring rubrics and exemplar conversations</li>
                        <li><strong>LLM-as-Judge Automation</strong>: Use the validated rubric to build automated evaluation scripts that can process thousands of conversations while maintaining evaluation consistency</li>
