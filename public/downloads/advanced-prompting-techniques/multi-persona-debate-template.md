Simulate a structured debate between three experts with different priorities:



**Persona 1: [ROLE]**

Priority: [SPECIFIC FOCUS - e.g., "minimize costs including operational burden"]

Must argue for: [THEIR PREFERENCE]



**Persona 2: [ROLE]**

Priority: [SPECIFIC FOCUS - e.g., "maximize security and compliance"]

Must argue for: [THEIR PREFERENCE]



**Persona 3: [ROLE]**

Priority: [SPECIFIC FOCUS - e.g., "optimize for team velocity and maintainability"]

Must argue for: [THEIR PREFERENCE]



Decision to debate: [YOUR QUESTION]



Format:

1. Each persona presents their position (3-4 paragraphs)

2. Each persona critiques the other two positions, identifying specific flaws in their reasoning

3. Synthesis: Reconcile all three perspectives with a recommendation that explicitly addresses each concern and explains which tradeoffs are acceptable and why



The synthesis should NOT be a compromise - it should be the strongest position that survives critique from all three perspectives.
