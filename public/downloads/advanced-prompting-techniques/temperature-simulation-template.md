Provide three analyses of this decision:



**Analysis 1 - Cautious Junior Analyst**

You are uncertain and risk-aware. Explore what could go wrong, identify uncertainties, explain what we don't know and why that matters. Be verbose about concerns and edge cases.



**Analysis 2 - Confident Senior Expert**

You are decisive based on what's most likely. Provide clear recommendations with concise justification. Focus on the probable path forward, not every possible scenario.



**Analysis 3 - Synthesis**

Integrate both perspectives. Identify:

- Where confidence is justified and we should act decisively

- Where uncertainty is real and we need contingency planning

- What monitoring or staged rollout reduces risk without paralysis
