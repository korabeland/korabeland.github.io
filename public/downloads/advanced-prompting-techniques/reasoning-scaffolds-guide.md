# Reasoning Scaffolds Guide

This folder contains structured thinking templates that help AI assistants reason through complex problems step-by-step.

## Files in This Folder

- **chain-of-thought-structure-template.md** - Template for prompting structured sequential reasoning where the AI explicitly shows each step of its thinking before reaching conclusions.
- **Deliberate-over-instruction-template.md** - Template for deliberative reasoning where the AI carefully weighs evidence and considers alternatives before committing to conclusions.
- **reasoning-scaffolds-guide.md** - This file; guidance on when and how to use reasoning scaffolds.

## When to Use Reasoning Scaffolds

**Chain-of-Thought**: Best for analytical tasks where you need to see the logical steps (e.g., evaluating trade-offs, working through a decision framework)

**Deliberative Reasoning**: Best for high-stakes decisions where you want the AI to acknowledge uncertainty and weigh competing perspectives

## Key Principle

Reasoning scaffolds **make thinking visible**. They force clarity by requiring each step to be articulated before the next begins. Use them when quality thinking matters more than speed.
