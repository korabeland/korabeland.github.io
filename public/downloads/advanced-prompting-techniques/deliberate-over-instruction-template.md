[YOUR ANALYSIS REQUEST]



Requirements for your response:

- Do NOT summarize or compress. I need exhaustive depth, not executive summary.

- For each point, expand with: implementation details, edge cases, failure modes, historical context, counterarguments

- When you identify a risk or tradeoff, explain the second-order consequences

- If you mention a best practice, explain when it doesn't apply

- Prioritize completeness over brevity - I will do my own compression later



Minimum length: [SPECIFY - e.g., "1500 words" or "5 detailed paragraphs per section"]
