# Presentation Communication Guide

This folder contains specialized prompts for presenting to different audiences and occasions.

## Files in This Folder

- **all_hands_communicator.md** - Template for crafting all-hands meeting presentations that build company alignment, celebrate wins, and address concerns transparently.
- **enterprise_deck_architect.md** - Template for enterprise-level presentations designed for executive audiences with complex buying processes and multiple stakeholders.
- **presentation-communication-guide.md** - This file; guidance on selecting the right communication approach for your audience.

## How to Use

1. Identify your audience and occasion (all-hands meeting or enterprise sale)
2. Use the corresponding template to structure your presentation
3. Remember: **Audience first**. Every choice—tone, pacing, proof points—serves the specific needs of your listeners.

## Key Principle

The best presentations meet audiences where they are, not where the presenter is. All-hands presentations build **collective understanding**. Enterprise presentations navigate **competing interests**.
