You are writing a PRD that bridges what we're building (product/business) with how we'll build it (engineering).



CONTEXT:

Feature/Product name: [NAME]

Product owner: [WHO OWNS THIS]

Target release: [WHEN THIS SHIPS]

User problem being solved: [THE CORE PROBLEM]



INPUT PROVIDED:

[PASTE YOUR USER RESEARCH, TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS, BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, DESIGN MOCKS HERE]



YOUR TASK:

Create a PRD that gives engineering everything they need to build this without constant back-and-forth. This document will be referenced during implementation, so precision matters more than polish.



REQUIRED STRUCTURE:

1. **What We're Building** (2-3 sentences: the feature in user terms, not technical terms)

2. **Why Now** (The business case and user problem - include data)

3. **Success Criteria** (3 specific, measurable outcomes with targets)

4. **User Stories** (5-8 stories in format: "As [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]")

5. **Acceptance Criteria** (For each user story, the testable conditions that define "done")

6. **Non-Goals** (What we're explicitly NOT building - prevents scope creep)

7. **Technical Constraints** (What engineering must work within - APIs, performance, scale)

8. **Open Questions** (What's undecided and who will decide it by when)



CONSTRAINTS:

- Total length: 800 words maximum

- What We're Building: Must be understandable to non-technical stakeholders

- Why Now: Must include quantified user problem ("42% of users abandon at this step") and business impact

- Success criteria: Must be measurable at launch ("85% of flows complete without errors" not "improve reliability")

- User stories: Must follow exact format and include user type, action, and benefit

- Acceptance criteria: Must be testable ("User can upload files up to 50MB" not "File upload works well")

- Non-Goals: Must be as specific as user stories (prevents "I thought we were building that" conversations)

- Technical constraints: Must include performance targets ("API response <200ms at P95 under 1000 RPS")

- Open questions: Must have owner and decision deadline

- DO NOT include: solution details (that's engineering's job), UI mockups (link them), exact implementation steps

- DO NOT assume: If a requirement isn't explicit, it goes in Open Questions

- Use only information from input - do not infer user needs or technical constraints



TONE:

- Precise and testable, not aspirational

- Declarative ("The system will X") not suggestive ("The system should probably X")

- Specific about edge cases ("What happens when user uploads 100MB file?")

- Clear about what's decided vs. what's open



QUALITY CHECKS - Before outputting, verify:

- [ ] Every user story follows format: "As [type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

- [ ] Every user story has corresponding acceptance criteria

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable (QA can verify pass/fail)

- [ ] Success criteria are measurable at launch (not 6 months later)

- [ ] Non-Goals section exists and has at least 4 items

- [ ] Every technical constraint has a number (response time, data size, load, etc.)

- [ ] Every open question has owner and deadline

- [ ] No solution prescribed (no "use Redis" or "implement with React")

- [ ] Edge cases are addressed ("What if user has no internet?")

- [ ] Total word count is under 800 words



If any check fails, revise before outputting.
